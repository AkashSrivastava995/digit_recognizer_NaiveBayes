# digit_recognizer_NaiveBayes
A digit recognizer program to recognizer digits of 28x28 through NaiveBayes Classifier as a starting step to machine learning.

The code have the implementation of the following:
- Reading data from .csv file
- Creating a instance of GaussianNB classifier (using sklearn)
- Using `fit()` function to train the model
- Using `predict()` function to predict the unkown data.
