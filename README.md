# digit_recognizer_NaiveBayes
A digit recognizer program to recognizer digits of 28x28 through NaiveBayes Classifier as a starting step to machine learning.

In this code we have implemented the following:
- Reading data from .csv file
- Creating a instance of Gausssian Naive Bayes Classifier (using sklearn lib)
- Training model using `fit()` method
- Predicting unkown data using `predict()` method
